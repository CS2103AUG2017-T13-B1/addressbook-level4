== LISA: Levels Integrated Secretarial Agent
LISA: Levels Integrated Secretarial Agent is a desktop address book application designed for insurance agents to manage the complex relationship between the providers and clients. It is developed by enhancing the original program "addressbook-level4" provided in class for teaching Software Engineering principles. While the main user interactions happen across CLI, LISA also has a GUI built with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.
