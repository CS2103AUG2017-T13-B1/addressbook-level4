== LISA: Levels Integrated Secretarial Agent
LISA: Levels Integrated Secretarial Agent is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

*Code contributed*: [../../collated/main/Juxarius.md[Functional code]] [../../collated/test/Juxarius.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Date Parser

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

Generalised to all forms of dates used in LISA to use this parser.

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The `LocalDate` class was used to store date data but it contained a strict parser on the format
of the input. It does not allow users to follow different input styles. The date parser was then
created for this purpose to allow more intuitive adding of dates and correction. Other date parser
APIs were considered but may require dependencies that the User may not have.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=dateParser]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Autofill Feature

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

As above in the edit feature.

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This idea stems from the consideration of convenience in editing typos in a contact.
This is especially so when the user wishes to update a small typo in very long field but
does not wish to re-type out everything in the current field.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=autofill]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Improved Tag management, allowing Tags to be added on and deleted without being overwritten

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=edit]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Tags are an important feature for LISA because of how it gives the user the freedom to connect
attributes to certain contacts. Overwriting previously saved tags mean a lot of work and unintented
mistake as the main use case of an edit function for tags is to add on rather than to replace.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=tagManagement]

#End of Extract#
